# GuitarChords

This Python program helps you understand guitar chords, their equivalent musical notes, and produces simple sound outputs with icons. It includes major and minor chords, and displays chord diagrams.

## How it works

The program defines major and minor chords along with their notes and frequencies. It then provides functions to play these chords and display simple chord diagrams.

When you run the program, it will play and display chords specified in the `main()` function. You can easily extend the program to include more chords, variations, and visualizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `winsound` library (for Windows)
- `time` module

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/GuitarChords.git
2. Navigate to the project directory using cd command.
3. Run the program: python GuitarChord.py


You can modify the `main()` function to play and display different chords.
